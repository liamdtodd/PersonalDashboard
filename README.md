# PersonalDashboard

This is a protoype for a web app that provides a personal dashboard for an individual. Each user will register/login into their account in order to use the application. The web app itself will have a calendar, to-do list, notes, reminders, and more. This data will be stored in a database so that the user(s) may access it upon a later login.
